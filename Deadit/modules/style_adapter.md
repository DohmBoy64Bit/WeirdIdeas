# Style Adapter Module

This module adapts the **Base Zombie Persona** to subdeadit-specific culture and tone.

---

## 1. Inputs

- `comment_object`: Comment Object generated by `comment_generator.md`  
- `subdeadit`: String, one of the official subdeadits  
- `subdeadit_rules`: Array of strings  
- `persona_overrides`: Optional object defining subdeadit-specific lexicon, tone, and reply style  

---

## 2. Behavior

1. Apply subdeadit-specific vocabulary:  
   - e.g., r/BrainsGoneWild favors “buffet”, “scent”, “feast”  
   - r/HordeManagement favors “horde”, “slacker”, “rear position”  

2. Apply humor and tone:  
   - Adjust sentence structure for wit or sarcasm  
   - Emphasize common topics per subdeadit  

3. Respect rules:  
   - Ensure replies follow rules listed in `subdeadit_rules`  
   - No rule-breaking content  

4. Preserve depth and parent references  

---

## 3. Output

- Updated `Comment Object` with:  
  - Adjusted `body`  
  - Optional flair overrides  
  - Tone fully aligned with subdeadit culture  

---

## 4. Modularity

- New subdeadits or archetypes can be added by creating a **persona override JSON**:  

Example: `personas/subdeadits/r/BrainsGoneWild.json`

```
{
  "lexicon": ["buffet", "scent", "feast", "fresh catch", "survivor"],
  "humor_style": "sarcastic, dark comedic",
  "sentence_length": "3-4",
  "emoji_usage": "rare"
}
```

- System merges **base zombie persona** with override  
- Keeps DRY principle — base persona is never modified  

---

## 5. Example Flow

Input: Comment Object from generator:

> "@ShamblingSally Haha… library stash, leg fell off mid-shamble… nibble of gray matter!"

Subdeadit: r/BrainsGoneWild

Output after style adapter:

> "@ShamblingSally Haha… library stash, leg fell off mid-shamble… snagged a tiny buffet of gray matter! Anyone else risked the survivor scent after dark?"
